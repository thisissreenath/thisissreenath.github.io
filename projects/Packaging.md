This paper offers an in-depth examination of packaging techniques for state-of-the-art Gallium Nitride HighElectron-Mobility transistors, tailored for electric vehicle applications. A range of materials, processes, and techniques for the substrate, die attach, insulator, conductor, die pads and conductor plating were investigated for reliability and their capacity to meet the thermal and electrical requirements. Systematic electrical characterization and thermal analysis were performed for the designed package. The study further explored next-level PCB design, material selection, and thermal analysis, considering the bottom-cooled nature of the package. Experimental evaluations of wire bond stress and strain tests were carried out to identify failure mechanisms, and the MIL-STD-883 Method 2011.9 standard was employed for wire bond pull testing to ensure bond pull force exceeded the minimum limit. Additionally, Shear stress tests were conducted to assess solder-die attach quality and compared against the MIL-STD-883 Method 2019.9 for die shear strength testing.
